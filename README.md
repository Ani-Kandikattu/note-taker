  This is a note taker application that allows users to write and save notes for later reminders. This can be useful for organization. I created this project to be on top of tasks throughout the day. This app involves using ExpressJs for the backend and is deployed using Heroku.

  To install this application, you can clone my code from the linked repository to your local device. You also need to install NodeJs, ExpressJs and NPM packages to operate the project.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  You can use this project by installing the packages and then running npm start, which starts express. You can then open the index.html page and start creating notes. You can also use heroku open to display the page.

  ## [Credits](#table-of-contents)

  The front-end code and index.js were provided by the bootcamp but the code within server.js is mine.
